# Resume Site Guide (Leo Gong)

This repo contains a single-file resume/portfolio site with a subtle music theme.
See the LaTeX guide `website_edit_guide.tex` for full details (customization, colors, backgrounds, hosting, troubleshooting).

Quick links:
- Edit colors at the top of the `<style>` block in `index.html` (CSS variables).
- Update resume path in header/footer: `assets/Your_Resume.pdf`.
- Background gradients/staff/notes are in `.staff` and `.note` CSS blocks.
